# Adapters

Adapters are small pieces of code responsible to load the panorama texture(s) in the THREE.js scene.

The supported adapters are:
- `equirectangular`: the default adapter, used to load full or partial equirectangular panoramas
- [cubemap](cubemap.md): used to load cubemaps projections (six textures)
- [equirectangular tiles](tiles.md): used to load tiled equirectangular panoramas
